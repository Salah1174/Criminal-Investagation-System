Before running this app, take in considiration the hard work that was made to make this system
works, we've spent a big time doing this project and applying things we've learned and didn't
learn as well ...

also... you might find the code named"MoSalah" as i named it like that without really knowing

last thing, disable 4996 error from the properties menu as i'm using the strcpy function


Thank You :)
